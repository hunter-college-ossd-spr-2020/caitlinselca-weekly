<h2>Starting to Contribute to a Project</h2>

**Throughout the semester, I will be contributing to Gatsby.js**
  <p>The project that my group and I have selected to work on throughout the semester is Gatsby.js. As the Github page states, Gatsby is a "free and open source framework based on React that helps developers build blazing fast websites and apps." Through our project evaluation, we deemed Gatsby extremely suitable to contribute to during the course of the semester and we believe it is a project that we will be invested in. From evaluating the Github of the project, it is apparent that there is a massive amount of activity in terms of issues and pull requests and we noticed that there is a strong sense of community welcomeness and responsiveness! We are extremely excited to work on this project throughout the semester.</p>

**Installing the Development Environment:**
<br>
In order to begin installing the development environment, from the Gatsby Github page, I clicked on tutorials so that I will be led a webpage that has a tutorial on how to set up the development environment. The [tutorial](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/tutorial/part-zero/) on setting up the development environment is extremely concise, however, it is long. I was able to get halfway through the instructions, and I have been successful thus far, but I will continue the other half of the instructions as this week continues.

**Issues I am Considering and How I am Filtering Them:**
<br>
There are a few issues I have seen on the Github that I would be interested in working on, these include:
   * [Issue #13708](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/issues/13708)
   * [Issue #21775](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/issues/21775)
   * [Issue #21852](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/issues/21852)
   * [Issue #21923](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/issues/21923)
   * [Issue #21962](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/issues/21962)
   * [Issue #21966](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/issues/21966)
   
   I am interested in working on these issues because they all appear to be issues that would be suitable for beginners to the project. I have been filtering issues I would be interested in working on through labels such as that "good first issue", "effort: low", "Learning", "type: documentation", and "type: ux". From reading through issues with these labels, they seem to be relatively simple and helpful in learning how to navigate Gatsby and work through beginner issues. I plan on continuing to view the different types of issues through labeling and, once I have fully installed the development environment, begin to find issues that intrigue me and begin working on them.
   
**Reading I Have Been Doing:**
<br>
I have been reading through the [Gatsby Github page](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby) along with the [Gatsby webpage](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/) in order to begin diving deeper into my research and understanding of Gatsby. There are numerous pages such as building with Gatsby (like sourcing data, deployment, and more), how Gatsby works behind the scenes, Gatsby APIs and configuration, and many more. I am invested in working on this project throughout the semester, therefore, I am extremely interested in learning more about it and I believe that reading will help me grasp more about the project I will be working on.
  
**Research I Have Done This Week:**
<br>
I continued my research into RXSwift! Although I learned a lot, and I would like to contribute to RXSwift in ways such as documentation or bug fixes, they have low community activity in terms of issues and pull requests. I would like to be involved in projects that are geared more towards my artsy side and have a high community activity. Thus, I plan on continuing research into this week on making contributions to projects such as _Magenta_ and _Bokeh_. I am also going to continue making further contributions to OpenStreetMap and my peers' blogs.
