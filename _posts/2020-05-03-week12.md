<h2>Week 12 Blog 💻</h2>

<h3>💭 Comments on Tom Callaway's blog post. </h3>



<h3>🖥️ Would you want to work in a company that only produced open source software? </h3>



<h3>💡 Thoughts on "Election fraud: Is there an open source solution?"</h3>



<h3>🔮 Progress on Gatsby Project:</h3>

As of last week, I began working on [Issue #22794](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/issues/22794). As this week occurred, I had also found another ticket I was interested in. 

<h3>📚 Research I Have Done This Week/Contributions:</h3>

I have continued reading articles on Open Source this week! My favorite ones included: [Confluent lands another big round with $250M Series E on $4.5B valuation](https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/21/confluent-lands-another-big-round-with-250m-series-e-on-4-2b-valuation/), [
Java security, mainframes having a moment, and more industry trends](https://opensource.com/article/20/4/java-mainframes-dev-skills-more-industry-trends), and [The rebirth of Mapzen, new projects bolster PyTorch, faster AI object detection, and other open source news](https://opensource.com/article/20/4/news-march-25)!
<p>I have made contributions to peer blogs and Gatsby so I am awaiting my pull requests to be merged! I will continue to make contributions throughout this following week.</p>
