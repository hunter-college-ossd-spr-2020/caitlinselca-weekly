**_Why did I decide to take a course in Open Source Software?_** The answer is simple. I knew almost nothing about open source software before entering this course, aside from its importance in the tech world, and was intrigued in learning more about _what_ it is and _why_ it plays such an imperative role. Additionally, I wanted to learn the history behind the development of open source, along with what softwares are classified as open source. Within this past week, I have learned that a few popular open source softwares include Mozilla's Firefox web browser, the Python programming language, and the RXSwift programming language. I was astonished upon learning this because the open, indepedent, and creative use of these softwares has allowed for the creation of numerous projects by a vast amount of users. With that being said, I believe that open source software gives creative power to users and enables advancements, creations, and contributions, in the tech world. Furthermore, I believe that a course in open source software will facilitate my understanding and appreciation of open source software, whilst improving my ability to evaluate, and make contributions towards, open source software projects.
