There are ways to contribute!

<h3>üè• Thoughts on the COVID-19 Open Source Project on Github:</h3>

**_Does this seem like a project to which you might be able to contribute?_**

After looking through the 2019 Novel Coronavirus COVID-19 (2019-nCoV) Data Repository by Johns Hopkins CSSE, I believe it is a project I would be able to contribute to! Since COVID-19 is a pandemic (affecting all countries, and people, globally), there are new statistics to be accounted for every day, whether these numbers are going up, down, or remaining the same. By having all of this data recorded in this Open-Source project, it allows for the community to get involved and relay accurate, well-researched information. This Open-Source project also keeps the Coronavirus statistics in an organized, singular place, which then allows for individuals to keep up with the global statistics on a daily basis.
<br>
As I examined the project, I immediately noticed that the README.md contained links to the visual dashboard for both desktop and mobile. I also noticed that the respository linked an abundance of various links to data sources as well as an email to contact them if an individual needs to. When I navigated to the issues section, it was clear that there were many tickets I could work on considering there are over 1,000 issues and they all seem relatively easy to work on if the individual does an extensive amount of research to ensure the information is accurate. When searching through the issues, it was easy to determine which ones I would like to work with because there were clear labels. The labels included: "bug," "documentation," "good first issue," and many others. Therefore, I believe that this project is one in which I would be able to contribute.

**_Would you contribute if you had time?_**

I would definitely contribute to this project!

<h3>üë©‚Äçüíª Thoughts on the Visit by Vicky Brasseur:</h3>

Upon the virtual visit to our class by Vicky Brasseur, I felt extremely grateful and informed by her presentation and was elated that she was able to deliver an immense amount of helpful information within the hour and fifteen minute span that our class takes place. 

<h3>üîÆ Progress on Gatsby Project:</h3>

As I have noted, I have chosen [Issue #22794](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/issues/22794) to work on! Throughout this week, I have made progression on this ticket.

<h3>üìö Research I Have Done This Week/Contributions:</h3>

As I have continued to research open source throughout this week, I wanted to do more through making further open source contributions, learning more about open source, and even expanding on what I have learned through class, research, and contributions. I have made numerous contributions to various projects throughout the week! These projects include: 
<br>
This past week, I had also stumbled upon a video that caught my attention called [Hackers Find Missing People For Fun](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2puBmXfi9Z0). As I watched, the narrator detailed a new project called _"Trace Labs"_ in which hackers compete to find missing people. In the video, it is described as crowdsourced Open Source Intelligence For missing persons. As I navigated to the [Trace Labs Website](https://www.tracelabs.org) to learn more about this project, it is stated that the project is designed to facilitate the process of finding missing persons locations. Through this, they are "Collecting open source intelligence (OSINT) on missing persons and providing that to law enforcement. We do this through CTF events at conferences and daily OSINT operations."
<p>Although different from Open Source Software, I was extremely intrigued by the mention of Open Source throughout the video and even the comments section. I was curious to learn more about the relation between OSS and OSINT, if any, and the differences. I found myself with a heightened curiosity and interest in this project specifically because of the knowledge that I have obtained about Open Source Software throughout this class. I feel that it is very exciting that I am able to learn more about different branches of Open Source, interact with those whom have knowledge about Open Source in the comments, and also find a project that I may be interested in keeping up with solely through taking this class.</p>
<p>I have also made contributions to Wikipedia and OpenStreetMap this week and have continued working on an issue for Gatsby! I will continue to make contributions throughout this following week.</p>
