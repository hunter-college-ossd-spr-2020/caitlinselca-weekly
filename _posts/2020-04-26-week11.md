<h3>👩‍💻 Thoughts on the Visit by Vicky Brasseur:</h3>

Upon the virtual visit to our class by Vicky Brasseur, I felt extremely grateful and informed by her presentation and was elated that she was able to deliver an immense amount of helpful information within the hour and fifteen minute span that our class takes place.

<h3>🔮 Progress on Gatsby Project:</h3>

As I have noted, I have chosen [Issue #22794](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/issues/22794) to work on! Throughout this week, I have made progression on this ticket.

<h3>📚 Research I Have Done This Week/Contributions:</h3>

As I have continued to research open source throughout this week, I wanted to do more through making further open source contributions, learning more about open source, and even expanding on what I have learned through class, research, and contributions.
