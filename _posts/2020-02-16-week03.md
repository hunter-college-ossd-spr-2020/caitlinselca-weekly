**_What skills do I have that would be useful for contributing to a FOSS project?_**

  <p> One significant skill that I have that would be useful for contributing to a FOSS project is open and concise communication. I believe that communication is a valuable and imperative skill when it comes to achieving the optimal result of a project. With this skill I will be able to effectively discuss a FOSS project with other contributors and users. Furthermore, I will be able to clearly and thoroughly describe, and express, any contributions I make, whether it be reporting a bug or submitting an idea. Being able to communicate with others whilst working on a project will help other contributors and users understand your thoughts, opinions, and what you are trying to achieve in order to improve the project. </p> <p>  Two other skills that I possess that I believe would be useful for contributing to a FOSS project are creativity and critical thinking. I believe that creativity and critical thinking work in conjunction and can be useful for contributing to a FOSS project when one needs to think outside of the box in order to improve the project. I especially believe that these skills come into use when suggesting new features and options, finding and fixing bugs, improving code, and helping write good documentation by correcting spelling and grammar mistakes.</p>


**_What things are the most interesting to me? What do I enjoy doing?_**

  <p>   Most things that I find interesting generally fall under the term: the arts. When I think of the arts, I immediately think about music, movies, paintings, and dance. I not only love viewing these things--as one would watch a movie or go to a museum to see artwork--but I also love partaking in these activities. I love making music, painting on a new canvas, and even taking up various dance classes. </p> <p>  Particularly though, I believe that open souce software will allow me to expand on my artwork. As I have found, Quil, which is an open source software, is a Clojure/ClojureScript library for creating interactive drawings and animations. I believe that as I continue to look into open source relating to art, I will be able to find numerous different projects which will allow me to experiment with my art and draw in curiosity towards different open source projects.</p>
