<h3>ðŸ”® Progress on Gatsby Project:</h3>

As of last week, I was working on both [Issue #22794](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/issues/22794) and [Issue ##23482](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/issues/23482). Since [Issue #22794](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/issues/22794) is slightly more difficult and I needed clarification on how to make this a successful contribution, I left a question on the issue so that Gatsby contributors will able to assist me in how to proceed with resolving this issue. I am awaiting a response and plan on making a pull request when I am able to. As for [Issue ##23482](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/issues/23482), I did the necessary research on the issues and resolved it! I have opened up a pull request for this ticket and it was merged! I was super excited to have my first major contribution merged and the maintainers were super kind! The maintainer who reviewed, and merged, my pull request noted that my changes made the Gatsby documentation more readable, clear, and helpful. After my pull request was merged, I was asked to become a maintainer of Gatsby and I was extended an invitation to join the Gatsby Maintainers team! I was unbelievably ecstatic about this and I am looking forward to making further contributions to Gatsby in the future!

<h3>ðŸ“š Research I Have Done This Week/Contributions:</h3>
I have continued reading articles on Open Source this week! My favorite ones included: [Confluent lands another big round with $250M Series E on $4.5B valuation](https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/21/confluent-lands-another-big-round-with-250m-series-e-on-4-2b-valuation/), [
Java security, mainframes having a moment, and more industry trends](https://opensource.com/article/20/4/java-mainframes-dev-skills-more-industry-trends), and [The rebirth of Mapzen, new projects bolster PyTorch, faster AI object detection, and other open source news](https://opensource.com/article/20/4/news-march-25)!
<p>I have made contributions to Gatsby! I am excited about what I have gotten done thus far and will continue to make contributions throughout this following week.</p>
